# Explanation:
## Health Record Management:

Patients can store health records (using storeHealthRecord), which are stored off-chain (e.g., in IPFS) and referenced by a hash.
Patients can retrieve their health records, but third parties need permission to access them (getHealthRecords).
Data Sharing (Permissioned Access):

Patients grant or revoke access to their health records by calling grantAccess and revokeAccess. Only addresses with permission can view a patient's records.
Token-based Incentives:

The HealthcarePlatform contract also extends the ERC-20 standard by using OpenZeppelinâ€™s ERC20 contract. Tokens are used to reward users for healthy behaviors. For example, the platform can send tokens to patients for keeping up with their checkups or sharing data when needed (rewardUser).
